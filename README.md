# Brain-Tumor-Detector
This is my project for the "EEE 312" course offered in BUET EEE in Level 3 Term I.

For detecting individual cases, use the SingleMRI.m file. For detecting multiple cases, use the BatchMRI.m file. To use the batch file, you must create a folder for MRI images and another folder for ground truth images.

The DICE coefficient, IoU and F1 score is evaluated by comparing the code's output to the ground truth images.

A sample MRI and ground truth dataset is provided here for testing.


This project is prepared by the following individuals:

Md. Ihasan Chowdhury Leyon,
